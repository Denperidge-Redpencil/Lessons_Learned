## Rocket.chat
HAVE YOU EVER USED SLACK?

### Biases IS THAT I HATE SLACK
- Okay that's mean. Slack has things going for it. But its proprietary nature and limited free plan and the fact it never feels quite right to use but maybe my brain longs for the ages of Windows Live Messenger make it a pain.
- Discord - while not beating Slack in terms of professionalism - beats it in pricing and UX department by many long shots. But its still proprietary

### Compliments
- Rocket.chat is open source and thus better Slack. It's exactly what it sounds like. It beats Slack in usage, and is more open source than Discord.
- It's been getting into federation, e.g. with Matrix. This will definitely up its reach.

### Complaints
- While beating Slack in usability and Discord in openness, it is less convenient than Discord.

## Matrix.org
THEIR SEO IS KIND OF UPSETTING.

### Compliments
- The idea of decentralised communication is great.
- The commitment to security is great.
- The plethora of possible homeservers allows for better implementations of the spec to keep coming.

### Complaints
- The SEO. It's rough. It's out of their hands, but it's still rough.
- It is *not* general consumer ready. Compared to services like Whatsapp, the entry friction for someone without a technological background is rough.
- I wish it had more personalisation.
- Most homeservers that aren't Synapse and Dendrite seem to be behind 
- A bunch of the core team seem to be working with Element which - while not inherently a problem, as they are largely open source - makes me afraid of future Matrix conveniences and design decisions being focused around Element. See the Matrix 2.0 spec with Element X seemingly being the only mobile client (at the time of writing) to support it.

## Excalidraw
A DIAGRAM TOOL THAT DOESNT MAKE ME WANT TO SCREAM. AT LEAST NOT NEGATIVELY.

### Biases
- I love SVG's. I've used many illustration programs. Adobe product pricing and licensing is rough.
- I love collaborative tools. Let me work on things together with my friends. Forge friendships in the crucible of battle (application development).

### Compliments
- No landing page. No mandatory signups. No pop-ups
- Built-in collaboration
- Export to SVG with an optional function to include the "scene", which allows re-opening it within Excalidraw just with the SVG.

### Criticisms
- I kind of struggle to come up with anything. It's a focused project and it *shows*. I love you Excalidraw team.

# Distros

Oh, some biases which apply to everything here:
- I have a decent amount of Linux background, albeit mostly through CLI. Ubuntu and Raspbian previously being OS's of choice.

## Manjaro
RECOMMENDED BY A FRIEND. JUSTIFIABLY SO.

To work from my home desktop on occasion, a dual boot with Manjaro was set up.

## Compliments
- We've all heard stories of Arch being great
- The Arch User Repository (AUR) means that pretty much any program has some sort of presence on it, and such your installations can end up real easy.
- It feels and runs good.

## Criticisms
- The AUR sometimes - justifiably - lags behind official releases. In some cases this is a big problem.
- The AUR also has a  relative increase in terms of security risk, due to it being... a user repository.

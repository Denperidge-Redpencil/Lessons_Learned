# Distros

Oh, some biases which apply to everything here:
- I have a decent amount of Linux background, albeit mostly through CLI. Ubuntu and Raspbian previously being OS's of choice.
- I'd love to see Linux become more widespread so that Microsoft is forced to improve their products.

## Opensuse
OPENSUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

### Compliments
- It works! Well!
- Zypper is a pleasant installer.

### Criticisms
- I don't particularly align with the GUI tools. But I don't know if I do with any GUI tools? Have I been broken?

## Manjaro
RECOMMENDED BY A FRIEND. JUSTIFIABLY SO.

To work from my home desktop on occasion, a dual boot with Manjaro was set up.

## Compliments
- We've all heard stories of Arch being great
- The Arch User Repository (AUR) means that pretty much any program has some sort of presence on it, and such your installations can end up real easy.
- It feels and runs good.

## Criticisms
- The AUR sometimes - understandably - lags behind official releases. In some cases this is a big problem.
- The AUR also has a  relative increase in terms of security risk, due to it being... a user repository.

# Programming_Stuff

## Ember.js
EMBER I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

### Biases
- I have used many frameworks before (e.g. Django, Laravel, ASP.Net), but my client-side framework experience is limited in comparison.
- While not opposed to quote-unquote big tech to my core, stuff like `killed by google` definitely shakens my fear. 

### Compliments
- Its documentation includes accessibility guides, smacked dead in the middle of its documentation. This is *amazing*, and solidifies their (in my humble opinion, correct). Compare this to:
    - Vue's accessibility guides, are put in the `Best Practices` category. I will give Vue the most credit aside from Ember due to the decent size of the tutorial, with a big amount of further links to resources as well as highlighting the importance (see [vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/accessibility](https://vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/accessibility.html)).
    - Angular.js being delegated to `Best practices` too, with mostly links to their own works e.g. Google accessibility guides and Angular components who aim to be accessible (see [angular.io/guide/accessibility](https://angular.io/guide/accessibility)).
    - React having an accessibility guide *only on their legacy site **in the advanced guides section***, with a new one being delegated to "What's next" for the last 7 months (see [Introducing react.dev](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-react-dev#whats-next) & [legacy.reactjs.org/docs/accessibility](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html))
    - (Note: I'm happy they have guides, even if small or tucked away. But credit and importance should be given to having it on the forefront)
- Its focus on longevity is quite nice
- Tools like EmberData and EmberInspector make development a *lot* better.
- The fact its governed by RFC's and is a largely independent organisation makes me comfortable in a long existence.

### Criticism
- Weird compatibility issues. Sometimes upgrading would change things drastically.
- The smaller userbase problem: less users --> less external documentation through StackOverflow or blog posts --> more friction --> less users --> ...
- Some build times were... Horrifying.


So do I recommend it? Kinda! I don't know if it'll outperform or outlast some of the other available options. But if you're looking for a longevity based open source client-side framework, definitely check it out.

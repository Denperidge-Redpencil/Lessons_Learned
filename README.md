# Lessons_Learned

As my time at Redpencil comes to an end, I wanted to have a collection of lessons learned.
Equally for myself, co-workers at Redpencil, or anyone that stumbles upon here!

This is my attempt at importing and cleaning up old notes & posts and forming them into as concrete a form as possible.
For the original notes, see...

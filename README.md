# Lessons_Learned

As my time at Redpencil comes to an end, I wanted to have a collection of lessons learned.
Equally for myself, co-workers at Redpencil, or anyone that stumbles upon here!

My favourite writings:
- [My Experiences/Short (to medium) thought on being trans at your work](My_Experiences/short-thought-on-being-trans-at-your-work.md)
- [Tools I Worked With/Communication Tools](Tools_I_Worked_With/Communication_Tools.md)
- [Long Projects/Documentation Rework](Long_Projects/Documentation_Rework/)

Navigation:
- [Active_Creations](Active_Creations/)
- [Learning_Notes](Learning_Notes/)
- [Long_Projects](Long_Projects/)
- [My_Experiences](My_Experiences/)
- [Tools_I_Worked_With](Tools_I_Worked_With/)



## Older versions
This is my attempt at importing and cleaning up old notes & posts and forming them into as concrete a form as possible.

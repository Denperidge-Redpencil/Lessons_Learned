# Things I worked with
Getting into a new (working) environment means getting acquainted with new technologies. So let's talk about a few! All of them will have compliments & criticism noted, alongside my biases due to previous experiences. Do note that this is all `at the time of writing`, being October 2023.

## Ember.js
EMBER I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

## Biases
- I have used many frameworks before (e.g. Django, Laravel, ASP.Net), but my client-side framework experience is limited in comparison.
- While not opposed to quote-unquote big tech to my core, stuff like `killed by google` definitely shakens my fear. 

### Compliments
- Its documentation includes accessibility guides, smacked dead in the middle of its documentation. This is *amazing*, and solidifies their (in my humble opinion, correct). Compare this to:
    - Vue's accessibility guides, are put in the `Best Practices` category. I will give Vue the most credit aside from Ember due to the decent size of the tutorial, with a big amount of further links to resources as well as highlighting the importance (see [vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/accessibility](https://vuejs.org/guide/best-practices/accessibility.html)).
    - Angular.js being delegated to `Best practices` too, with mostly links to their own works e.g. Google accessibility guides and Angular components who aim to be accessible (see [angular.io/guide/accessibility](https://angular.io/guide/accessibility)).
    - React having an accessibility guide *only on their legacy site **in the advanced guides section***, with a new one being delegated to "What's next" for the last 7 months (see [Introducing react.dev](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-react-dev#whats-next) & [legacy.reactjs.org/docs/accessibility](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html))
    - (Note: I'm happy they have guides, even if small or tucked away. But credit and importance should be given to having it on the forefront)
- Its focus on longevity is quite nice
- Tools like EmberData and EmberInspector make development a *lot* better.
- The fact its governed by RFC's and is a largely independent organisation makes me comfortable in a long existence.

### Criticism
- Weird compatibility issues. Sometimes upgrading would change things drastically.
- The smaller userbase problem: less users --> less external documentation through StackOverflow or blog posts --> more friction --> less users --> ...
- Some build times were... Horrifying.


So do I recommend it? Kinda! I don't know if it'll outperform or outlast some of the other available options. But if you're looking for a longevity based open source client-side framework, definitely check it out.

## Matrix.org
THEIR SEO IS KIND OF UPSETTING.

## Compliments
- The idea of decentralised communication is great.
- The commitment to security is great.
- The plethora of possible homeservers allows for better implementations of the spec to keep coming.

## Complaints
- The SEO. It's rough. It's out of their hands, but it's still rough.
- It is *not* general consumer ready. Compared to services like Whatsapp, the entry friction for someone without a technological background is rough.
- I wish it had more personalisation.
- Most homeservers that aren't Synapse and Dendrite seem to be behind 
- A bunch of the core team seem to be working with Element which - while not inherently a problem, as they are largely open source - makes me afraid of future Matrix conveniences and design decisions being focused around Element. See the Matrix 2.0 spec with Element X seemingly being the only mobile client (at the time of writing) to support it.

## Rocket.chat
HAVE YOU EVER USED SLACK?

### Biases IS THAT I HATE SLACK
- Okay that's mean. Slack has things going for it. But its proprietary nature and limited free plan and the fact it never feels quite right to use but maybe my brain longs for the ages of Windows Live Messenger make it a pain.
- Discord - while not beating Slack in terms of professionalism - beats it in pricing and UX department by many long shots. But its still proprietary

## Compliments
- Rocket.chat is open source and thus better Slack. It's exactly what it sounds like. It beats Slack in usage, and is more open source than Discord.
- It's been getting into federation, e.g. with Matrix. This will definitely up its reach.

## Complaints
- While beating Slack in usability and Discord in openness, it is less convenient than Discord.

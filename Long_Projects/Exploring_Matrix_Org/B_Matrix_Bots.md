## 00_Mermatrix_Original

Repo: https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/Mermatrix-archive

The first Matrix bot I made, allowing for Mermaid.js to be used in it. A lot of this code would become the basis of Matrix Bot Starter down the road.

I realised that much of the code in the original Mermatrix was out of scope for the project, yet they made it better. All general-usage code got put into an npm package to kickstart development.

The Mermatrix bot, now made using the matrix-bot-starter!

## 03_SPARQLIX

Repo: https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/Sparqlix

Have you ever wished you could test out/run sparql queries within your matrix room?

No?

Hm.

# Note
This is an import [from my original notes repository]() original draft of my notes to quicky help someone get started with the diataxis/divio documentation structure! They've been integrated into [Denperidge-Redpencil/project](https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/project).


# Divio Docs Quickstart
An attempt at boiling down the amazing [30min talk/documentation](https://documentation.divio.com/) on how to write better documentation into something unobtrusive enough for people familiar with it to use as a checklist, but instructive enough for people unfamiliar with it to somewhat do the thing.

## Does your documentation include...

### Tutorials?
For each tutorial: write as if you're *teaching a child how to cook*.

Checklist:

- [ ] Holds the readers hand from start to finish
- [ ] Gives a sense of achievement
- [ ] Works for everyone, with minimal explanation
- [ ] Also teaches what ***you*** take for granted

### How-To guides?
For each how-to: write down how to achieve **1** specific thing as if it were a *cooking recipe*.

Checklist:

- [ ] Only 1 practical goal per how-to
- [ ] Minimal explanation
- [ ] Flexible: works for different but similar uses 


### A reference?
For each reference: write as if you are writing an *encyclopedia* article.

Checklist:

- [ ] Structured like the codebase
- [ ] Doesn't explain common tasks ([how-to guides](#how-to-guides))
- [ ] Doesn't explain basic concepts ([tutorials](#tutorials))
- [ ] Fully describes the machinery

### Explanations: discussions/background material?
For each background material: write as if you're writing about the *history and context* of a subject.

Checklist:

- [ ] Explains design decisions
- [ ] Considers alternatives
- [ ] Helps the reader make sense of things

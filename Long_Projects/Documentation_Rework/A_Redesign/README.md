# Documentation_Rework__A_Redesign

One of the hardest things in the beginning was redesigning how the documentation is written and displayed.
The problems with the RPIO & S.W documentation were multiple:
- Incomplete, with some information never being written down
- Spread out (input), with some information being solely in videos or chat logs
- Inconsistent, with different projects taking up different forms
- Spread out (output), with info that should be more cohesive being written down into different locations, and no good way to have a full overview

This redesign would ideally fix all of this. That's a decent amount:
- Adhere to our company's values
- Standardise everything
- Collect everything
- Still make it easy to write
- Display everything nicely

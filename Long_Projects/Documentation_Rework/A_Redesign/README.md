# Documentation_Rework__A_Redesign

One of the hardest things in the beginning was redesigning how the documentation is written and displayed.
The problems with the RPIO & S.W documentation were multiple:
- Incomplete, with some information never being written down
- Spread out (input), with some information being solely in videos or chat logs
- Inconsistent, with different projects taking up different forms
- Spread out (output), with info that should be more cohesive being written down into different locations, and no good way to have a full overview

The redesign had to ideally fix all of this. That's a decent amount:
- Standardise everything (1)
- Contain everything (2)
- Still make it easy to write (1)
- Display everything nicely (3)
- Still adhere to our company's values (1)
- Create an easier onboarding process (2)

So many, many talks and repos and system exploration over (see also the notes I made attempting some automated documentation generators at [the Learning.md repo, Denperidge-Redpencil@Github](https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/Learning.md/blob/main/Notes/docs.md#sidequest-automated-generation))...

## 1: A structure was outlined
This is with much thanks to [@madnificent](https://github.com/madnificent/), one of the lead people behind Semantic.works, dealing with *many* questions about preferences and visions. In the Masterclass videos, they already talked about the Divio documentation and future documentation processes. The notes went through MANY drafts (in combination with work on part 2 below), but eventually I ended up with two end documents:
 
### [documentation-structure.md @ Denperidge-Redpencil/du-project](https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/du-project/blob/master/docs/discussions/documentation-structure.md)
I am *incredibly* happy with this document. It's an amalgamation of what the new structure is, how it is implemented, and also *why*. It contains the answers to everything. It's a highly condensed version of the results of this document.

### [quickstart-writing-documentation.md @ Denperidge-Redpencil/du-project](https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/du-project/blob/master/docs/how-tos/quickstart-writing-documentation.md)
This document contains three things
- Simple instructions on where your documentation should go
- An incredibly simple checklist on whether you correctly structured your documentation
- How to properly configure a revision release

1. So, [a new structure was outlined](#1-a-structure-was-outlined). Cool. Now do something with it.
2. Content was imported: [see B_Adapting_Existing_Content in this repo](../B_Adapting_Existing_Content/)
3. Tools were created: [see C_Collecting_Parsing_Viewing in this repo](../C_Collecting_Parsing_Viewing/)

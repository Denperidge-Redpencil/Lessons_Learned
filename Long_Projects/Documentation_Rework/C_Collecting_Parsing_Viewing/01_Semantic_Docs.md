## Info
- Date: December 16
- Repo: https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/semantic-docs
- Deployment: http://redpencil.denperidge.com/semantic-docs/

A relatively simple script, using public api's to collect repos & jinja2 to export a static website.

## Things it did well:
- No JavaScript needed. I like that. It's all immediate. Can be hosted on a regular static host
- Rather simple codebase
- Can be re-run without maintenace to add new repos

## Things it lacked:
- Incredibly basic styling
- Aside from showing the README contents, it doesn't do much

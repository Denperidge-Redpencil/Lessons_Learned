## Info
- Date: May 17
- Repo: https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/AnyArgs

A split off from Divio Docs Gen. With minimal code, read & save config arguments through .conf, CLI, .env files & environment variables at once.

## Things it did well:
- What it had to do!
- It had tests! Yay.

## Things it lacked:
- More advanced things. List types & duplicate args never ended up implemented.
- Discovering python-benedict meant that this project wasn't exactly needed anymore.
  I used what I had learned from this project to contribute to python-benedict.
  See the [pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/fabiocaccamo/python-benedict/pull/311).

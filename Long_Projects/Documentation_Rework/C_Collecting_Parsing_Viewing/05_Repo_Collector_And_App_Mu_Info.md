## Info
- Date: Jan 30
- Repo (1): https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/Repo-Collector
- Repo (2): https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/app-mu-info-archive

- Repo-Collector was meant as a script to collect data/contents from different repo source, and specifically that.
- Repo-Collector then quickly got merged *into* an app-mu-info rework

## Things it did well:
- Repo-Collector was simple and to the point.
- This was shaping up to become a full fledged datapoint for the Semantic.works repositories.

## Things it lacked:
- The python code parts would've been better as a standalone service. And that's what we did!

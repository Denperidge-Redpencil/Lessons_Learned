## Info
- Date: December 16
- Repo: https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/automated-frontend-semantic-works
- Deployment: https://redpencil.denperidge.com/automated-frontend-semantic-works/

A fork of the original frontend, integrating what was learned from Semantic-Docs.

## Things it did well:
- Outputs a static Ember.js website.
- Keeps most of the original site's code, but uses an API to dynamically fetch repos & README contents.

## Things it lacked:
- While static, requires Ember.js compatible hosting.
- Does not do any of the other fancy things (versioned & parsed documentation)
- Still has leftover problems from the original (minimal responsiveness & accessibility, etc)

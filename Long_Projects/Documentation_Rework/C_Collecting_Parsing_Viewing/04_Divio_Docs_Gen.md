## Info
- Date: January 20
- Repo: https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/divio-docs-gen

A Python project that outputs divio-docs parsed markdown (in strings or on disk),
accounting and storing info about the repository source.

## Things it did well:
- It worked pretty okay.
- It had a template repository to help with setting things up.
- A pypi release!

## Things it lacked:
- It being a parser *and* outputter became too complex of a codebase. Hence it was split up down the road.
- No built-in versioning support.

# Learning.md: Notes from learning to work with the Semantic.Works stack

## Docker-Ember
### Install
A way to install [docker-ember](https://github.com/madnificent/docker-ember) without having to change your path, compliant with Linux directory standards (I think), and having it all neatly tucked away.
```bash
cd /usr/local/lib/
git clone https://github.com/madnificent/docker-ember.git
cd ../bin/
ln -s ../lib/docker-ember/bin/* .
```
Usually symbolic links are made using absolute paths, but in /usr/local/ it's not unheard of to use relative (npm, for example, does this).

---

### User namespace
If you don't want every file generated to be owned by root, change the userns-remap! This might especially be beneficial in production environments where security is key. Check [the Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/) for more info.

Now, the default way is mapped out [here](https://github.com/madnificent/docker-ember#on-linux-1). Below are the changes I made to both steps, and why.

#### /etc/sub{u,g}id

- Skipping this step causes `EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '...'` when trying to mount/create files using Docker.
- Original step:
    - ```bash
        echo "$( whoami ):$(id -u):65536" |  sudo tee -a /etc/subuid
        echo "$( whoami ):$(id -g):65536" |  sudo tee -a /etc/subgid
        ```
    - I think the provided command didn't work for me because /etc/{subuid,subgid} had existing values for my user (`...:100000:65536`). I tried ignoring the existing values and just adding the new values to the end of the file. But to no avail: the created files' ownership belonged to the UID/GUID of the pre-existing values, not (easily) editable for my own user.
- New step:
    - Replacing the existing value for my user in the file. `...:100000:65536` --> `...:1000:65536` & `...:100:65536` in subuid subgid respectively.

#### daemon.json
Instead of editing the service startup, you can use the daemon config file!

Edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json`, and add the following
```json
{
  /* ... */
  "userns-remap": "username:group"
}
```
According to the documentation, you can use `"UID:GID"`, but I used `"username:groupname"`. 
Alternatively, you can set the value to `default`, which then uses a user generated by Docker.

#### Restart

Afterwards, restart the docker service using `systemctl restart docker.service`. If Docker fails to start, you can use `dockerd --debug`.

### Uninstall
```bash
cd /usr/local/bin/
rm ed edi edl eds
cd ../lib/
rm -rf docker-ember/
```

## Full-reset a crashed virtuoso container
Note: this will probably remove all data. So don't do this if there's important data. But if you're like me and had a goofed container from minute 1, here's how you fully remake it!

```
docker-compose rm -fs database
rm data/db/{virtuoso*,.backup_restored,.data_loaded,.dba_pwd_set}
```

## mu-migrations-service
Make sure to:
- Use the http://mu.semte.ch/application graph
- define mu:uuid

```sql

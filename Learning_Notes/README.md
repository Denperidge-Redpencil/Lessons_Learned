# Learning_Notes

Some files are tagged with Learning.md, this is a reference to the [Learning.md GitHub repository](https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/Learning.md) I created for my first few months are Redpencil.

Oh, and due to the deprecation of a previous file, I do want to point out score.dev's existence.

# Paperwork
Turns out you have to do paperwork and manage a lot of accounts.

## Useful stuff
- SyncThing: sync files between work devices
- FireFox Multi-Account containers: no longer need to log in and out of work stuff

## Local folder structure
I have a SyncThing folder syncing all my work documents.

```
|_ Assets
|_ Contracts
|_ Journal
|_ Other
|_ Things I've been up to
|_ Sickness
```

### Assets
Random binary files, images I needed for projects and such.

### Contracts
What it says on the tin! My work contracts I needed them for reference!

### Journal
Positive feedback I received. Sometimes morale gets low and, this helped a lot.

### Other
Silly things I made. Only two images were in there, and I added them both here for your viewing pleasures
![A gif of a heart locker opening. It slowly opens, revealing inside on the right a picture of a building, and on the right the name of the building (Herman Teirlinck)](assets/Herman%20Teirlinck.gif)
(Look, the office there is great)

![An image of a man in boxing gear and a battle pose. It says "ok ima learn SPARQL" poorly edited onto it. Below it it shows the man sitting down exhausted, drinking water. The text says "damn", followed by a screenshot of a SPARQL Query returning empty results](assets/Ok%20ima%20learn%20sparql%20damn.png)

### Things I've been up to
To help keep track of my hours worked and what I did, and also who I did it for (internal operations or clients) this folder contained files of what I did. The files are named `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g. 2023-11-03.md) so the newest files are on the bottom/top depending on your sorting. Older months get added to an Archive folder within it, as to not clog up the directory too much.

The files had the following structure:
```md
8:40-12:00 (3h20)
-----------------
- IO: worked on internal operations projects

13:00-17:30 (4h30)
------------------
- CLIENT: work on client project X

17:30-17:40 (10min)
-------------------
- IO: paperwork

IO: 3h20 + 10min = 3h30 = 3.5h
CLIENT: 4h30 = 4.5h
```

This way, it was easy to keep track of what I did for who, and whether I hit my hours.

### Sickness
When your body gives in, make sure to not lose your sickness notice like an idiot. Yes this happened to me. Not anymore. Hopefully.


## Cloud drive
A Google Drive 

```
|_ $PROJECTNAME
|_ Drive-based paperwork
|_ Static storage
|_ Traning notes (link)
|_ Writeups
|_ Cats redpencil webportal (file)
```

### $PROJECTNAME
Shared documents for the project in question

### Drive-based paperwork
Like the Contracts in my local folder, but instead... on Drive. Solely used whenever I had to share things etc

### Static storage
Like the Assets folder. I used this for my Masterclass patch video (one of their videos had an obstructive visual bug in it, so I fixed it).

### Training notes
Shared folder with internal notes I made during training.

### Writeups
Other writeups I've done during training. Also contained links to the training notes

### Cats redpencil webportal
Where I originally linked all my work! This got replaced by https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/denperidge-redpencil.github.io, and now https://github.com/Denperidge-Redpencil/Lessons_Learned (this repository)
